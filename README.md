# ClubeDePiadas

The idea of the App is:

"Easily and quickly create and share text jokes".

PS: Jokes was just the context I chose for this project, but all the code within this app can be reused for
any application that has the format of a social network, so you can reuse everything here in your next project!

# Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, 
code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

Email-me: maikorodrigues787@gmail.com

Also, you can use this Project as you wish, be for study, be for make improvements or earn money with it!

It's free!

# Some Observations about this App

to download the api available at [API-Laravel]( https://github.com/MaikonRodrigues/ApiLaravelForAndroidTest), configure it and run on a local server.

2 - The options available in the Settings screen are to change the photo and the username, it is also possible to edit the jokes.
